# MIRA-128f Implementation on ARM-A53

This repository contains a modified implementation of the MIRA-128f post-quantum digital signature scheme, optimized for ARM Cortex-A53 architecture. This work is part of my Master's capstone titled **"Toward Migrating an Implementation of Post-Quantum Digital Signature on Resource-Constrained Devices"**.

## Overview

MIRA-128f is a post-quantum digital signature scheme designed to be secure against quantum computing threats. This implementation focuses on adapting MIRA-128f for resource-constrained devices like those powered by the ARM Cortex-A53 processor. The work presented here includes modifications aimed at migrating MIRA into ARM-A53 processor, creating a baseline for further optimization of the scheme.
